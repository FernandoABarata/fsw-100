            LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General<br>
            revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical<br>
            intelligence information with black highlighters.
        </p>    
        <p>
            According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages" —are marred<br>
            by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that<br>
            began at the agency's inception in 1947.
        </p>
        <p>   
            CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the pariculars of several<br>
            historic events, such as:

            <ul>
                <li>the Cold War</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul>
